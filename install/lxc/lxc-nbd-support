#
# This script relies on the fact that the host that hosts the container has
#   nbd support. That means that the following command has been executed (or
#   any equivalent):
#
#   $ modprobe nbd max_part=16

#
# Why this? because LXC does not create the nbd devices needed to use qemu-nbd
# so we are creating them (this will work if the lxc container has permission
# to use the nbd device).
# The permissions to manage nbd devices are enabled by starting the lxc container
# with a configuration file with the next lines:
#
#   lxc.include = /var/lib/lxc/<containername>/config
#
#   # Allow the container to mknod (needed by qemu-nbd...)
#   lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c *:* m
#   lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = b *:* m
#
#   # Allow the container to use the host's nbd devices
#   lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = b 43:* rwm # Every nbd device in the host

# Why this? because in lxc the creation of the nodes corresponding to the partitions
# in the nbd devices are not created when the device is connected using the qemu-nbd
# application. So we need a udev rule that is triggered when a partition is added
# and an app that creates the devices to allow mounting them.
