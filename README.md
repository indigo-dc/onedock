# ONEDock
This project intends to provide support for OpenNebula to create Docker containers and deliver them to the end user as if they were Virtual Machines.

## 0. FAQ (what to expect from ONEDock)

### What is ONEDock?
ONEDock is a set of extensions for [OpenNebula](http://www.opennebula.org) to use containers as if they were virtual machines (VM).

The concept of ONEDock is to configure Docker to act as an hypervisor. It behaves just as KVM does in the context of OpenNebula.
### But, how does it work?
When you ask OpenNebula for a VM, a Docker container will be deployed. You will get an IP and you will be able to interact with it from OpenNebula as if it was a VM.

### This looks similar to ONE-enabled Docker-Machine. Is it?
No. Docker Machine and other projects deploy VMs in different cloud providers (e.g. OpenNebula, OpenStack, Amazon EC2, etc.). Then, they install Docker on them and, afterwards, you can deploy Docker containers on top them.

Instead, ONEDock deploys Docker containers on top of bare-metal nodes, thus considering the containers as first-class citizens in OpenNebula.

### Containers are different to VMs. Will the user interaction be different when using ONEDock?
No. ONEDock almost fully integrates with OpenNebula, so the user can use the common ONE commands (i.e. onevm, oneimage, etc.) to interact with ONEDock. The very same interaction is maintained but, instead of deploying VMs, Docker containers are deployed.

### Cool! How does it work?
1. You register an image using the ``oneimage`` command
2. ONEDock will download the image from Docker Hub
3. You request a VM that uses that image
4. ONEDock will create the container, and the container will be  daemonized (e.g. kept alive).
5. You can access the container (e.g. using ssh).

### Wait a minute. You need to configure the network, right?
Not actually. Different containers will have different IP addresses. All the ports are available in the IP address that ONE will assign to the container. Therefore, you do not need to deal with opening ports and all that stuff.

### Sounds like magic! What is the caveat?
Well, ONEDock is under active development. Some open issues are the VNC console in Sunstone and others.

Moreover Docker is also under very active development and, so, the integration with new versions may not work (e.g. in two weeks docker went from 1.8 to 1.9). Please tell us if you notice that problems arise with new versions.

## 1. Assumptions

You have a linux installation with [OpenNebula](http://www.opennebula.org) on it. It is assumed that you have a local Docker registry v2.0 installed in a host (named dockerregistry), which is the same ONE frontend. Moreover the folder in which the docker images are stored is known and it is accessible from the command line. If you do not have such deployment please follow the instruction of section [_Quick deployment of a test environment_](#5-quick-deployment-of-a-testing-environment).

## 2. Environment

This project has been tested under the following environment (for both the front-end and the working nodes)
* Ubuntu 14.04
* jq package installed
* ONE 4.12
* user oneadmin is able to execute docker (i.e. is in group "docker"; usermod -aG docker oneadmin)

## 3. Installation

### 3.1 Front-end node

Once both OpenNebula and the jq package have been installed, you can install ONEDock as follows (as root user):

```bash
cd /tmp/
git clone https://github.com/indigo-dc/onedock
cd onedock
./setup_files.sh
```

ONEDock will be installed. Then you should adjust the variables in ```/var/lib/one/remotes/onedock.conf``` according to your deployment. In particular:

* LOCAL_SERVER points to the local docker registry
* DATASTORE_DATA_PATH points to the folder in which the images in the docker registry are stored

#### 3.1.1 Activate ONEDock in ONE

In order to activate ONEDock in ONE, you just need to update the /etc/one/oned.conf file.

```bash
cat >> /etc/one/oned.conf << EOF
IM_MAD = [
      name       = "onedock",
      executable = "one_im_ssh",
      arguments  = "-r 3 -t 15 onedock" ]

VM_MAD = [
    name       = "onedock",
    executable = "one_vmm_exec",
    arguments  = "-t 15 -r 0 onedock",
    type       = "xml" ]

TM_MAD_CONF = [
    name = "onedock", ln_target = "SYSTEM", clone_target = "SYSTEM", shared = "yes"
]
EOF
```

Then you must add onedock to be available as transfer manager and datastore. Please locate the proper lines in /etc/one/oned.conf file and append the ```onedock``` keyword. In the default installation, the result will be similar to the next one:

```bash
TM_MAD = [
    executable = "one_tm",
    arguments = "-t 15 -d dummy,lvm,shared,fs_lvm,qcow2,ssh,vmfs,ceph,dev,onedock"
]

DATASTORE_MAD = [
    executable = "one_datastore",
    arguments  = "-t 15 -d dummy,fs,vmfs,lvm,ceph,dev,onedock"
]
```
### 3.2 Computing nodes

You need to update the file ```/etc/sudoers.d/opennebula``` to add the file that will configure the network. You need to add the line

```bash
Cmnd_Alias ONEDOCK = /var/tmp/one/docker-manage-network
```

And to activate this alias appending the alias in the following line

```bash
oneadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ONE_MISC, ONE_NET, ONE_LVM, ONE_ISCSI, ONE_OVS, ONE_XEN, ONEDOCK
```

## 4. Using ONEDock

### 4.1 Creating the datastore

To create the datastore you just have to create a new datastore using the onedock type for both datastores and transfer manager. An example (as oneadmin):

```bash
$ cat > onedock.ds << EOF
NAME=onedock
DS_MAD=onedock
TM_MAD=onedock
EOF
$ onedatastore create onedock.ds
```

### 4.2 Creating images
First, switch to the oneadmin account:
```
sudo su - oneadmin
```

Then you have to create a image in the new datastore. An example (as oneadmin):

```bash
$ cat > ubuntu-docker.tmpl << EOF
NAME="ubuntu"
PATH=docker://ubuntu:latest
TYPE=OS
DESCRIPTION="Imagen de Ubuntu"
EOF
$ oneimage create -d onedock ubuntu-docker.tmpl
```

The PATH can be set to a real image in docker hub (prepending _docker://_ and using the docker hub notation) or to a docker image file exported by using the command ```docker save```. In case that the path points to a docker resource, ONEDock will download it to the local registry to avoid that the internal nodes have to get it from the Internet.

### 4.3 Creating a virtual network

You have to create a virtual network to be used for the containers. An example (as oneadmin), that has to be customized for your network:
```bash
$ cat > docker-private.net << EOF
NAME=private
BRIDGE=docker0
NETWORK_ADDRESS = "172.17.42.1"
NETWORK_MASK    = "255.255.0.0"
DNS             = "172.17.42.1"
GATEWAY         = "172.17.42.1"
AR=[TYPE = "IP4", IP = "172.17.10.1", SIZE = "100" ]
EOF
$ onevnet create docker-private.net
```

In this example we assume that the we are using the ```docker0``` bridge, and it allows packet forwarding and network access to the containers, but you can create your own bridges (e.g. br0, br1, etc.) to configure your network as usual.

This example also assumes some specific network parameters, but you should set the parameters of your network (i.e. IP address, DNS, gateway etc.).

You can list the details of the ``docker0` interface to find out the correct values for DNS and GATEWAY:
```
$ ifconfig docker0
docker0   Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 02:42:cd:ae:8a:e2  
          inet addr:172.17.0.1  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.0.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::42:cdff:feae:8ae2/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:17476 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:19686 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0
          RX bytes:965292 (965.2 KB)  TX bytes:67255682 (67.2 MB)
```
In the previous example, these should be set to 172.17.0.1.

### 4.4 Adding a virtualization host

Now you should add some virtualization hosts, as usual. You can use the onedock VMM:

```bash
$ onehost create $HOSTNAME -i onedock -v onedock -n dummy
```
The use of $HOSTNAME in this particular case is for using the OpenNebula front-end as one of the hosts on which to deploy containers.

### 4.5 Docker container deployment

#### 4.5.1 Creating a Container Template

You have to create a template to be used to run containers. An example (as oneadmin), that has to be customized for your new container can be:

```bash
$ cat > onedock.vm << EOF
NAME = container
CPU = 2
MEMORY = 1024
DISK = [ IMAGE_ID=0 ]
NIC = [ NETWORK_ID=0 ]
CONTEXT = [
        NETWORK = "YES"
]
EOF
$ onetemplate create onedock.vm
```

Finally you can deploy one Docker container instantiating the new template:

```bash
onetemplate instantiate container
```

(where the parameter ```container``` points to the just created template name).

#### 4.5.1 Creating a Container by Command Line Interface (onevm: manages OpenNebula virtual machines)

You can run containers directly running the CLI onevm. An example (as oneadmin), that has to be customized for your new container can be:

```bash
onevm create --memory 512 --cpu 1 --disk ubuntu --nic private --net_context
```
(where the parameter --disk ubuntu points to the just created image id).

Notice that the very same OpenNebula interfaces are used but instead of deploying a VM, a Docker container.

## 5. Quick deployment of a testing environment

In the folder ```install``` you have a set of scripts that will help you deploy a testing environment.

### 5.1 Scenario #1: Using Vagrant

1. Install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/)
2. cd vagrant
3. vagrant up

This installs OpenNebula with OneDock support.

4. vagrant ssh
5. sudo su - oneadmin
6. onevm create --memory 512 --cpu 1 --disk ubuntu --nic private --net_context

You can use ``onevm show`` to find out the IP and connect to the container using SSH.

### 5.2 Scenario #2: Using it in a VM (or bare metal)

Clone the repository and get into the folder
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/indigo-dc/onedock
$ cd onedock
```

Then install as needed

1. Install ONE
      ``` $ sudo ./install/install-one ```
2. Install Docker
      ``` $ sudo ./install/install-docker ```
3. Install the docker-registry
      ``` $ sudo ./install/install-registry ```
4. Launch the docker-registry
      ``` $ sudo ./install/launch-registry ```
5. Follow the instructions in _Installation_ section or execute
      ``` $ sudo ./install/install-onedock ```

### 5.3 Scenario #3: Using it into a lxc container

If you want a single-node stand-alone installation of ONEDock, you can get a running _lxc_ container in an ubuntu 14.04 distro by simply executing the next commands (this installation assumes that you have installed lxc):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/indigo-dc/onedock
$ cd onedock/install
$ ./create-lxc ashlan --create
$ lxc-attach -n ashlan
```

Now you can go to section [using ONEDock](#4-using-onedock), and start using ONE.

Warning: This is not as easy as it seems... sometimes docker fails to start and you need to delete the /var/lib/docker folder, restart docker by hand and re-launch the registry.
